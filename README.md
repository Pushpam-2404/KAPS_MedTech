## 🚀 Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Installed and running locally)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kaps-medtech.git
cd kaps-medtech
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Node.js packages for the backend.
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the **`backend/`** directory.
```bash
# Create file: backend/.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/kaps_health
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_random_key_here
PORT=3001
```
*Note: Replace `your_user`, `your_password`, and `kaps_health` with your local Postgres credentials.*

### 4. Initialize Database
Run the setup script to create tables and seed the database with demo data (Students, Doctors, Depts).
```bash
node backend/init_db.js
```
*You should see a success message indicating tables were created and seed data inserted.*

### 5. Run the Server
Start the backend server (which also serves the frontend files).
```bash
node backend/server.js
```
The server will start at: `http://localhost:3001`

### 6. Access the App
Open your browser and enter:
`http://localhost:3001`

## ☁️ Deployment Guide (Vercel + Neon)

Since this app uses a database, we cannot just deploy to a static host. We use **Vercel** for the app and **Neon** for the serverless PostgreSQL database.

### 1. Set up Cloud Database (Neon)
1.  Go to [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and Sign Up.
2.  Create a Project (e.g., `kaps-medtech`).
3.  Copy the **Connection String** (e.g., `postgres://user:pass@...neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`).

### 2. Initialize Cloud DB
Run the init script from your local machine, pointing to the Cloud DB.
```bash
# Run this in your local terminal
DATABASE_URL="YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING" node backend/init_db.js
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
1.  Push your code to **GitHub**.
2.  Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) -> **Add New Project**.
3.  Import your repository.
4.  **Environment Variables** (IMPORTANT):
    Add the following in Vercel settings:
    -   `DATABASE_URL`: *Paste your Neon Connection String*
    -   `JWT_SECRET`: *Any secure random string*
5.  Click **Deploy**.
